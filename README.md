# InsertionSort
Test speed of Insertion Sort for randomly shuffled arrays of NSNumbers. Arrays range in size from 1,000,000 entries to 10,000,000. For each size array, 100 shuffles and sorts are done and the sort phase is timed. A CSV file is created containing 2 columns: Array Size, and Time to Sort in Milliseconds.

The CSV file was then uploaded to Google Docs and a spreadsheet was generated. Then a point spread chart was created from that. The resulting chart was published at:
